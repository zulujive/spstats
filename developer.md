SPStats is a simple application that uses PHP for the backend and simple HTML and CSS for the frontend. The backend includes scripts to track image updates, generate content and authenticate users. The config file is effectively a list of variables that is referenced in other scripts. For example, the theming options will change dependent variables according to the theme which sets various colors differently.

Hopefully as the application grows, we'll see more stuff in here. The idea behind this was to add as much configuration, customization and compatibility so the project can easily scale. The goal is to make the code as accessible as it can be to those who want to deploy the app.
